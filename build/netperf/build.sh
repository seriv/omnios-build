DESC="Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of many different types of networking. \
It provides tests for both unidirecitonal throughput, and end-to-end latency. \
The environments currently measureable by netperf include:\

TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6\
DLPI\
Unix Domain Sockets\
SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6"         # Longer description, must be filled in
